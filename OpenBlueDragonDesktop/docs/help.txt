OpenBD Desktop Server Help
_______________________________________

This software is designed to get you up and running as quickly and as painlessly as possible.

Getting started couldn't be easier; simply choose a directory on your file system using the [Browse] button.  If the folder does not already contain a valid OpenBD runtime, then one will be created for you, with all the necessary support and JAR files.

If the folder is an existing OpenBD runtime, then the Desktop will take over the management of the JAR files for this particular project.   All JAR files will be replaced with the ones that ship with the OpenBD desktop.   Existing JAR files will be moved out into the "./shadow/" folder where you can pick them up.

Sometimes you need to specify extra JAR files in your runtime.   To facilitate this, the folder "./customjars/" in the Desktop root folder is there for any custom JAR files that you wish to placed into the main WEB app folder.   Simply drop your jar files into this folder, and restart the web-app.


Deploying to Google App Engine requires that you first register a new application with Google.   Use the link in the "Export to Google" tab to visit the Google App Engine website.

The Desktop does not store your Google username/password.   It merely passes it onto the underlying Google Deployment Library that posts your application through an HTTPS connection.

      |_|   Desktop Server


The OpenBD Desktop Server is a complete ready to 
run server environment for developing both standard
and Google App Engine web apps.


--] Getting Started [--------------------------------------

Windows:  
	Double click on 'OpenBlueDragonDesktop.exe"

Linux:
  % sh OpenBlueDragonDesktop.sh
  
  
--] Setting up [-------------------------------------------

The desktop ships with everything you need for development.
The only software required is the Java JDK 1.6

You can quickly start developing a web-app by pointing it to
any folder on your system.   It will automatically prepare
this folder for the necessary web development.


--] Exporting [--------------------------------------------

When you are ready to export your application, the desktop 
can package it up either as standard J2EE WAR file, or 
upload it straight to the Google App Engine environment.
